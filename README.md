# Recipes App in React Native
## Description:
A react-native app that allows users to browse food recipes, read their description & cooking steps and visualize their ingredients. For each ingredient, users can also browse all the recipes that use that specific ingredient. The app also has support for recipe categories and comprehensive native search functionality. Additionally, all the data feed is modularized, so you can plug in your own backend effortlessly.
